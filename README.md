# IoT Overspeeding Detector ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

An IoT-based overspeeding detector uses an ultrasonic sensor to monitor vehicle speed within a certain range. If overspeeding is detected, a notification is sent to a Telegram bot, and data can also be monitored via ThingSpeak.

## Features
- **Real-time Speed Detection:** Detects overspeeding using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Sends instant alerts to a Telegram bot when overspeeding occurs.
- **Data Monitoring:** Logs speed data on ThingSpeak for analysis.
- **Visual Indicators:** Uses LEDs and a buzzer for local alerts.

## Components
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266):** Main microcontroller for IoT connectivity.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Measure speed and distance.
- **16x2 LCD Display:** Displays real-time speed and status.
- **100Î© Resistors:** Current limiting for LEDs.
- **Red & Green LEDs:** Indicate normal and overspeed conditions.
- **Buzzer:** Audible alert for overspeeding.
- **Jumper Wires:** Connections between components.
